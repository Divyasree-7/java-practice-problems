# java-practice-problems
This repo is where I practice Java coding problems.  
Iâ€™m mainly focusing on problem solving and improving my logic by solving questions from platforms like LeetCode.  
Each file contains the Java solution for a particular problem, sometimes with a short explanation or example.
